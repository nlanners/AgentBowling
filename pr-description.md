# UI Improvements and Fixes - Phase 3 Completion

## Summary

This PR completes Phase 3 of the development roadmap by implementing several UI improvements and fixing critical issues in the bowling score application. The changes improve user experience by enhancing scrolling behavior, fixing layout issues, and ensuring type safety throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. GameScreen Scrolling Fix

- Added ScrollView to GameScreen to ensure all content is accessible
- Fixed the issue where the Reset Frame button was cut off at the bottom of the screen
- Improved layout with consistent spacing and padding

### 2. Scoreboard Auto-scrolling Enhancement

- Completely reworked the auto-scrolling logic to better track active frames
- Improved calculations for scroll positions based on screen dimensions
- Added buffer padding to ensure the current frame is centered properly
- Increased timeout duration for more reliable scrolling
- Added safeguards to prevent scrolling beyond content boundaries

### 3. PlayerSetupScreen Design Improvements

- Added horizontal padding (20px) to improve visual spacing
- Implemented SafeAreaView for better iOS compatibility
- Enhanced input fields and buttons with more consistent sizing
- Improved visual hierarchy with better spacing between elements
- Added rounded corners to player items for a more modern look

### 4. Type Safety Improvements

- Fixed type errors in PlayerSetupScreen by correctly implementing button styles
- Added proper type safety to GameSummaryScreen with optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- Ensured all components follow TypeScript best practices

## Testing

The changes have been tested on both iOS and Android simulators, ensuring that:

- All screens are fully scrollable
- The scoreboard correctly tracks and scrolls to the active frame
- The PlayerSetupScreen layout is properly padded and visually consistent
- All type errors have been resolved (verified with `npm run typecheck`)

## Screenshots

## Completion Status

With these changes, Phase 3 of the technical plan is now complete. All UI components and screens specified in the plan have been implemented and are functioning as expected. The application now provides a solid foundation for implementing the statistics functionality planned for Phase 4.

## Next Steps

The next phase (Phase 4) will focus on implementing basic statistics calculations and building statistics display components.
