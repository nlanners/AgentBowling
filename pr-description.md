# Bowling Score App - Phase 1 Implementation

## Overview

This pull request completes Phase 1 of the bowling score tracking application built with React Native and Expo. It establishes the core architecture, navigation system, data models, and persistence layer that will serve as the foundation for future development phases.

## Changes

### Project Setup and Configuration

- Set up React Native with Expo and TypeScript
- Configured ESLint for code quality
- Established development workflow with custom rules in `.cursor/rules`
- Created comprehensive specifications for the entire application

### Theme System

- Implemented a complete design system including:
  - Typography: Font families, sizes, weights, and text styles
  - Colors: Primary/secondary palette with light/dark mode support
  - Spacing: Consistent layout scale
  - Border radius: Standardized corner values
  - Shadows: Elevation styles for components
- Created ThemeContext with provider for app-wide theming

### Navigation Structure

- Implemented React Navigation with native stack navigator
- Created all main application screens:
  - HomeScreen: Entry point with main navigation options
  - PlayerSetupScreen: For adding/managing players before a game
  - GameScreen: Main game interface with scoring
  - GameSummaryScreen: End-of-game results display
  - HistoryScreen: View past games and statistics
- Set up navigation types and proper screen transitions

### Data Models

- Defined TypeScript interfaces for all core data structures:
  - Player: User information and state
  - Roll: Individual bowling throw
  - Frame: Bowling frame with scoring logic
  - Game: Complete game state with players and frames
  - GameHistory: Collection of past games
- Added utility types and constants for scoring logic
- Implemented with full TypeScript type safety

### Persistence Service

- Created storage service using MMKV for efficient local storage
- Implemented methods for:
  - Saving/loading current game state
  - Managing player profiles
  - Recording game history
  - Clearing data when needed
- Added error handling and data validation
- Created custom React hook (useStorage) for easy access throughout the app

## Technical Achievements

- Fully type-safe implementation with TypeScript
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Service-based approach to data persistence
- Component structure ready for future enhancements

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

- Implement bowling score calculation logic
- Create game state management using React Context
- Develop frame and scoring utilities
- Add validation for bowling rules
- Create unit tests for scoring logic
