# Component Architecture Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the component architecture for the bowling score application. It defines the structure, organization, and relationships between React components, promoting reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Component Organization

The application will follow a feature-based organization of components with clear separation of concerns:

```
/src
  /components          # All components
    /ui                # Generic UI components
    /layout            # Layout components
    /forms             # Form-related components
    /game              # Game-related components
    /players           # Player management components
    /history           # History and statistics components
    /scoreboard        # Scoreboard-specific components
  /screens             # Screen-level components
  /navigation          # Navigation components
  /hooks               # Custom React hooks
  /contexts            # Context providers
  /utils               # Utility functions
  /types               # TypeScript type definitions
    /constants         # Application constants
  /services            # Services for external interactions
```

## Component Hierarchy

### Screen Components

Top-level components representing full screens:

1. **HomeScreen**

   - Displays welcome message and main navigation options
   - Contains NewGameButton, ViewHistoryButton

2. **PlayerSetupScreen**

   - Manages player selection before game starts
   - Contains PlayerList, AddPlayerForm, StartGameButton

3. **GameScreen**

   - Main game interface with scoring and frame display
   - Contains Scoreboard, PinPad, PlayerTurnIndicator

4. **GameSummaryScreen**

   - Displays final scores and game stats
   - Contains FinalScoreCard, GameStats, ActionButtons

5. **HistoryScreen**
   - Displays list of past games
   - Contains GameHistoryList, FilterControls

### Feature Components

Mid-level components implementing specific features:

1. **Scoreboard**

   - Visual representation of bowling frames and scores
   - Contains FrameRow, ScoreRow, PlayerIndicator

2. **PinPad**

   - Interface for entering pin counts
   - Contains PinButton, SpecialActionButtons

3. **PlayerManager**

   - Interface for managing players
   - Contains PlayerList, PlayerForm

4. **GameControls**

   - Controls for game actions (reset, undo, etc.)
   - Contains ActionButton

5. **HistoryViewer**
   - Interface for viewing game history
   - Contains HistoryList, HistoryDetails

### Base UI Components

Low-level, reusable components:

1. **Button** - Customizable button component
2. **Card** - Container with standard styling
3. **Input** - Text input with validation
4. **Modal** - Popup dialog component
5. **Badge** - Visual indicator for states (strike, spare)
6. **Icon** - Customizable icon component
7. **Typography** - Text components with consistent styling
8. **Spinner** - Loading indicator

## Component Communication

Components will communicate through these patterns:

1. **Props** - For parent-child communication
2. **Context** - For sharing state across component tree
3. **Custom Hooks** - For sharing behavior and accessing context
4. **Events** - For communication between unrelated components

## Component Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each component should do one thing well
2. **Encapsulation** - Components should hide internal implementation details
3. **Composability** - Prefer composition over inheritance
4. **Reusability** - Design components to be reused when possible
5. **Testability** - Components should be easy to test in isolation

## Component Lifecycle Management

1. **Initialization** - Set up initial state, subscribe to contexts
2. **Cleanup** - Unsubscribe from contexts, clear timers
3. **Error Handling** - Use error boundaries for component-level error handling

## Styling Approach

The application will use React Native's StyleSheet with a consistent approach:

1. **Component-scoped styles** - Each component defines its own styles
2. **Theme variables** - Colors, spacing, typography from central theme
3. **Responsive styling** - Adapt to different screen sizes
4. **Platform-specific styling** - When needed for platform consistency

## Performance Optimization

Component performance will be optimized through:

1. **Memoization** - Use React.memo for expensive components
2. **List Virtualization** - Use FlatList for long scrollable lists
3. **Lazy Loading** - Load components only when needed
4. **Pure Components** - Avoid unnecessary renders

## Accessibility

Components will support accessibility through:

1. **Semantic Elements** - Use appropriate native elements
2. **ARIA Attributes** - Include accessibility attributes
3. **Focus Management** - Implement proper keyboard navigation
4. **Screen Reader Support** - Test with VoiceOver and TalkBack

## Testing Strategy

Components will be designed for testability:

1. **Unit Testing** - Individual component testing
2. **Integration Testing** - Testing component interactions
3. **Snapshot Testing** - Visual regression testing
