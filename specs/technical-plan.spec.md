  /assets              # Static assets
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Bowling Logic Implementation

The core bowling logic will be implemented following these principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   - Scoring logic separate from UI
   - Frame management separate from game management

2. **Immutable State**

   - No direct state mutations
   - New state created for each update

3. **Pure Functions**
   - Scoring calculations implemented as pure functions
   - Easy to test and reason about

### State Management Strategy

The application will use React Context with an approach similar to Redux:

1. **Context Providers**

   - GameProvider for active game state
   - PlayerProvider for player management
   - HistoryProvider for game history
   - UIProvider for UI state

2. **Actions and Reducers**

   - Action creators for each state change
   - Reducers to handle state transitions
   - Action types defined as TypeScript enums

3. **Custom Hooks**
   - `useGame()` hook for game state and actions
   - `usePlayers()` hook for player management
   - `useHistory()` hook for history access
   - `useUI()` hook for UI state

### Persistence Implementation

Data persistence will be implemented as follows:

1. **Service Layer**

   - Abstract storage implementation details
   - Provide type-safe methods for data access

2. **Automated Persistence**

   - Auto-save game state on critical changes
   - Load saved state on app startup

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallbacks for storage errors
   - Data integrity validation

### UI Implementation

The UI will be implemented with these approaches:

1. **Component Composition**

   - Small, focused components
   - Composition over inheritance

2. **Responsive Design**

   - Flexible layouts with React Native
   - Orientation and screen size adaptations

3. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Memoization for expensive components
   - List virtualization for long lists

4. **Theming System**
   - Centralized theme with colors, spacing, typography
   - Common reusable styles
   - Dark mode support
   - Theme context for dynamic styling

## Testing Strategy

The application will be tested using:

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Jest for logic and utilities
   - React Native Testing Library for components

2. **Integration Tests**

   - Test component interactions
   - Test navigation flows

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Multiple device testing
   - Edge case validation

## Deployment Strategy

The application will be deployed using Expo's build service:

1. **Development Builds**

   - Regular development builds for testing
   - Distribution via Expo Go

2. **Production Builds**
   - Standalone builds for App Store and Google Play
   - Optimized for performance and size

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Complex Scoring Logic**

   - Risk: Bowling scoring rules are complex
   - Mitigation: Thorough unit testing, edge case validation

2. **State Management Complexity**

   - Risk: Managing game state can become complex
   - Mitigation: Clear state architecture, immutable patterns

3. **Performance with Large History**

   - Risk: Performance issues with many saved games
   - Mitigation: Pagination, virtualized lists, efficient storage

4. **Device Compatibility**
   - Risk: Different behavior across devices
   - Mitigation: Extensive cross-device testing, responsive design

## Future Enhancements

After completing the core functionality, these enhancements could be considered:

1. **UI Themes** - Light/dark mode and custom themes
2. **Advanced Statistics** - More detailed performance analytics
3. **Export/Import** - Data portability features
4. **Multiplayer** - Local multiplayer enhancements

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. All prioritized user stories are implemented
2. The application functions correctly offline
3. Bowling scores are calculated accurately
4. The UI is intuitive and responsive
5. Data persists correctly between sessions
