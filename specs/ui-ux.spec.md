## Component Design

### Scoreboard Component

## Interaction Design

### Scoring Workflow

1. App displays current player and frame
2. Player enters pins knocked down in roll 1
3. If strike, automatically move to next player/frame
4. If not strike, prompt for roll 2
5. After roll 2, move to next player/frame
6. Special handling for 10th frame with strikes/spares

### Error Prevention

- Disable impossible pin counts based on previous roll
- Confirmation for destructive actions (reset game, delete player)
- Ability to edit previous frames with confirmation

## Responsive Design

- Support for both portrait and landscape orientations
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- Optimized for one-handed operation on phones

## Micro-interactions

- Subtle animations for frame transitions
- Haptic feedback for input confirmation
- Visual feedback for strikes and spares

## Accessibility

- Support for VoiceOver and TalkBack screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for all text
- Touch targets at least 44x44 points
- Support for dynamic type (text size adjustment)

## Offline Usage

- All UI components will function without requiring network connectivity
- Appropriate caching and local storage for uninterrupted usage
