- This is a new day. Please create a new prompt file titled `2025-06-02.prompt.md` and reveiw the project so you know where we are.
- When creating a cloud build, I keep getting this build error:

- Would switching from `pnpm` to `npm` help solve this issue? How difficult would that change be to make?
- I think I'd like to switch to `npm`. `pnpm` has been causing me more problems than it solves lately. Please make that conversion and update any related documentation throughout the project.
- Alright. EAS cloud build is taking too long to test effectively so I've installed Android Studio and successfully have the app running. I'd like to continue development. Please look at the project and @technical-plan.spec.md and determine what the next step should be. List the next steps in our plan for me.
- These are some good first steps. After running through the app a couple times, I've noticed some glaring implementation issues that I think might take precedence. Examine these suggestions and determine if these should be implemented/fixed now or if something else should be done first.

1. When a game is complete, there is no way, other than navigating "back" using the device's gestures, to get back to the home page or navigate anywhere else. I think we should have some sort of button to accomplish this.
2. In a game, the player's frames go off the screen. This is fine, until the player gets to about frame 8, where the user has to scroll to see their frames. Can we implement an auto scroll to always ensure the active frame is visible on screen?
3. In a game, the player name wraps in a weird way and it looks bad. Could we truncate the player name instead of wrapping it?
4. The 10th frame is not handled correctly. If the player marks a strike in the first throw of the 10th frame, the second throw changes the strke button to a spare button. This also happens for the third throw of the 10th frame. We need special logic to handle the pin input for the 10th frame to work and calculate correctly.

- Yes, let's start with the 10th frame logic. Please adjust and get this working correctly. Let me know if you need advice on how this should work. You are also free to search the web if you deem necessary to make sure your logic is correct.
- These are good changes, but it's not quite done. When the second throw of the 10th frame is a strike, the frame display is only showing a `10` instead of the Strike icon. Also, when the third throw of the 10th frame is input, the score doesn't seem to be updating correctly. For example, when inputting a perfect game (13 strikes) the score at the end shows 280 instead of the expected 300. Please fix these issues and make sure to update the proper tests with your changes.
- We are getting closer. However, when I start a new game, the previous game's score and game progress isn't reset. This is making it difficult to test as I have to close and restart the app to test a new game. Please fix this so that a new game starts fresh.
- It's looking good. One last thing for this portion: the 2nd throw of the 10th frame still isn't displaying right. When there is a strike, it displays an `X` correctly, but it doesn't have the green circle around it like every other throw with a strike. This throw needs to display jsut like any other strike thrown.
- Excellent. Please re-list the prioritization from earlier so we can determine our next step.
- Let us proceed. Implement the post-game navigation.
- I am not seeing the new buttons. I see where they are in the code, but I can't find them in the actual app when it is running. When a game completes, all I see is the "button" saying Game complete from the @Scoreboard.tsx component. I don't see the buttons that are in the @GameScreen.tsx component. Please remove the duplication and ensure that the end game buttons appear.
- That's better. Now can you remove the banner that appears after clicking a pin button? It is moving the PinPad up and down and is very distracting. I don't need this.
- cool. Now where are we on our most recent prioritization list?
- Alright let's continue and fix up the frames going off screen
- Hmmm.. something has happened on the Player Setup screen. I can't seem to type in the "Enter player name" input. Was this caused by something you changed? Or is something wrong with my emulator?
- A few issues:

1. The Reset frame button at the bottom of the game screen is cut off and I can't scroll the page to access it.
2. The auto-scrolling on the ScoreBoard is "kind of" working. But it is inconsistent and often only scrolls by a tiny bit and doesn't keep the active frame on screen.
3. I liked parts of the previous PlayerSetupScreen design more than this. Can you combine them? Especially by adding some padding against the sides of the screen.
