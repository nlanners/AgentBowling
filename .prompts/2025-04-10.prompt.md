- We are going to be building a simple app using Expo and React Native to keep track of bowling scores. You will be doing most of the work. First, we need to set up the rules for how you and I will interact. I would like you to create a directory called `.prompts`. In this directory, create a file called `2025-04-10.prompt.md`. In this file copy this prompt as the first item in a markdown list. This will help me keep a transcript of our interactions for future use. There is no need to copy your response to this file. Just my prompt.

- Excellent. For each prompt I give you, I need you to copy that prompt into this file as a new list item. Now we will set up a directory of rules for you to follow. You must always follow this rules unless I expressly direct you otherwise. Create a directory called `.cursor/rules` now.

- As our first rule, we will create a file called "basic-interaction". Create a description that outlines the instructions I have give you previously. This rule should be attached to all files and apply to every interaction we have. Format this rule file in such a way that will grant to most consistent and correct behavior.

- Now we are going to set up our basic environment. Please set up this project to use Typescrip, React Native, and Expo for general mobile app development.

- I'm sorry. I interrupted you to answer questions in the terminal to set up the expo app. Please continue as if the `npx create-expo-app` has been finished.

- This basic implementation is a good start. Now we will adjust things to work how I want. First, we are going to create a series of Spec files, culminating in a Tech Plan, for us to follow and ensure the end product fits our needs. During this process, you will not write any code until I explicitly tell you to. To ensure this, please create a new rule file in `.cursor/rules` called `spec-creation.mdc` in a similar format to `basic-interaction.mdc` that applies to any prompt concerning writing `.spec.md` files. This rule must out line that no code or code snippets should be written while working on spec files. spec files need to be written in markdown format.

- Excellent, now we will start on the specs. Create a new directory called `specs`. For the first file, we will write some user stories. Please create `user-stories.spec.md` and write some basic user stories for a bowling scores app.

- One adjustment, please deprioritize number 18, as I don't intend to add network connection or activity at this time. This app should work fully offline.

- Markdown automatically adjusts the list numbering and it has now been messed up after your adjustments. Please fix the numbering of the list so it is sequential without repeat numbers. Update the Priority section to properly refer to the correct priorites after updating the numbering.

- Now, create a series of spec files to out line the specifications that will be needed to accomplish these user stories. Separate them in a logical and efficient manner. Keep in mind good software engineering principals, along with best practices for Typescript, React Native, and Expo.

- These specs are good except for the persistence spec. Your knowledge seems to be out of date. The AsyncStorage has been removed from React Native. Please redo this spec file with a different persistence method.

- You have added code snippets to the persistence spec file. Why did you violate the spec-creation rule to do this?

- Yes

- We are done for today. Please look at my staged git changes and write an appropriate commit message.

- Today is a new day. Please check the files in the @rules directory and create a new `.prompt` file called `2025-05-29`

- We were getting into a loop of unhelpful information from our previous chat. I want to start a little fresh.

When I run the eas build, I get this warning on the Run expo doctor step:
Running "expo doctor"
Running 15 checks on your project...
13/15 checks passed. 2 checks failed. Possible issues detected:
Use the --verbose flag to see more details about passed checks.
✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in /home/expo/workingdir/build/bowling-scores/app.json:
should NOT have additional property 'builds'.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/
✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android, plugins.
Advice:
Add '/android' and '/ios' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build
2 checks failed, indicating possible issues with the project.
Command "expo doctor" failed.
npx -y expo-doctor exited with non-zero code: 1

Please explain what is going on here and whether it is responsible for my gradlew falilures. If not, what is causing this. I can clearly see that the gradlew file is in the android directory. Why can't EAS find it?

Use the @Expo to figure this out please.

- I am still getting the same error.

Build failed

ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/expo/workingdir/build/bowling-scores/android/gradlew'

- Do I need to push my repository to github for the cloud build to work? Could that be what is breaking?
