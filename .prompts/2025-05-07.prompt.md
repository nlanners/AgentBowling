- We are going to continue working on this project. Before we start, make a new prompts file with the name `2025-05-07`. Then review the rules in @.cursor to ensure that you follow them. Also review the @specs files and review the project then summarise the work that we have done so far.
- Please check that the unit tests work. I just ran `pnpm test` and got several failures.
- You've gotten yourself in a loop. I think our testing setup has gotten messed up. I'd like to start it over. Please remove all files and code related to testing.
- I don't want you to restore the testing infrastructure or attempt to fix it at this moment. I want you to remove everything related to testing so that we can start over from scratch later. Remove everything related to testing.
- Now, we are going to rebuild the testing infrastructure. However, don't just copy what you have done previously. I want you to follow the @specs files and be very careful while building the tests. After each test, I want you to run the tests and ensure they work. Make sure to use the best testing practices for Expo and React. Let me know if you have any questions.
- Why are you trying to edit an older prompt file?
