# Prompts for May 30, 2025

- We are in a new day. Please create a new prompts file titled `2025-05-30.prompt.md` to save prompts in. Review our @rules and @specs files and the project as a whole to get caught up on where we are. Let me know when you are ready to work.
- Please run `pnpm tsc` and fix all the type errors.
- When I run the app, I'm getting the following error:

[runtime not ready]: Error: Failed to create a new MMKV instance: react-native-mmkv 3.x.x requires TurboModules, but the new architecture is not enabled! \*Enable the new architecture in your app to use react-native-mmkv 3.x.x. (See https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/blob/main/docs/enable-apps.md)

Please investigate this and fix it.

- Instead of downgrading, I would like to upgrade the architecure to Turbo Modules. Before doing this, please explain how much work would need to happen. What needs to change?
- I agree with your recommendation. Please procede with the upgrade.
- When I run `pnpm start` it looks like it is trying to run using Expo EAS. I would like to use Expo Go on my phone to test. What needs to change to allow that?
- I was not aware that Expo Go does not support the New Architecture. I am fine using EAS. Can you please explain how I go about testing my app with EAS? I have never done it before.
- I am getting this error when trying to run a local build for android. Please diagnose and explain to me what is happening and how to fix it.
- I have installed JDK 24 on my system. I am still getting this error when trying to build
- When I run `brew tap homebrew/cask-versions` I get this error. How do I proceed? Error: homebrew/cask-versions was deprecated. This tap is now empty and all its contents were either deleted or migrated.
- I'm still getting this error with JDK 17. Please diagnose. Use @Expo to help you.
- I have done the steps above and they seem to not work. When I run the prebuild script I get this. Is this correct?
- When running from local project I get this. Is this necessary or can I ignore it if I'm not planning on using a device emulator?
- I am getting this error on the cloud build: Build failed

ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/expo/workingdir/build/bowling-scores/android/gradlew'

You mentioned earlier about checking the @app.json configuration. Can you please do that?
