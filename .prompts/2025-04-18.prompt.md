- A new day. Please set up a new .prompt file called `2025-04-18.prompt`

- Please check the specs and technical plan and tell me where we left off. What is the next step for this project?

- Alright. Let's begin phase 2. Please implement the bowling score logic. Keep the @specs files and cursor rules in mind, please.

- Verify that the work that was just done complies with the files in the @specs directory. Make changes as necessary. When work has been verified, mark off the technical plan appropriately.

- Can you actuall mark step complete in the @technical-plan.spec.md ?

- The previous prompts also need to be added to the prompt file please.

- Let us continue to the next step. Please Create game state management using context.

- Run our verification process and when the work has been verified, mark the @technical-plan.spec.md appropriately.

- Let's continue. Develop frame and scoring utilities

- Again, run verification and mark the plan appropriately.

- **Continue to the next step**

  - Agent missed this prompt completely

- I had to step away. Please validate that the previous step was carried out correctly, according to the @specs files, and correct any lint and/or type errors. Once you are satisfied with it's completeness, mark the @technical-plan.spec.md accordingly.

- Did you follow my last prompt correctly?

- Why are you ignoring @basic-interaction.mdc in the cursor rules?

- Going back to your check, you said that "The validation is functionally complete but has integration issues:
  validateFrameRoll is defined but not used
  The validation logic is duplicated between different files
  Some components like PlayerForm properly use GameValidationHelper"
  and
  "The validation implementation is partially done but not fully integrated"
  yet you marked the step in the technical plan as complete. If your issues are still in the code, then the task is not complete. Please correct these mistakes, make the code without duplication between files, and remove unused functions.

- Which step of our interaction have you missed?

- While that is fine, that is not the interaction I was speaking of. You are forgetting to include and perform the @basic-interaction.mdc cursor rule. Why are you missing this and how can we correct that behavior?

- This IDE won't let you change the rule on your own. Please give me a version of the @basic-interaction.mdc that will help you follow the process you have outlined.

- Please add my previous prompt to the prompt file

- Let us continue to the next step of the @technical-plan.spec.md

- Let's finish up for the day. Please look at my staged changes and create an appropriate commit message.

- please add the `/bowling-scores/coverage` directory to the `.gitignore`

- Now let's create a commit of my changes. First ensure that my last few prompts are in the prompt file. Then create a commit with an appropriate message to github.

- I've already unstaged the coverage directory. Please update the prompts file then commit what is currently staged.

- The prompts file is not up to date. I have given you 2 prompts (including this one) since its last update. Please update, stage all changes, and commit.
