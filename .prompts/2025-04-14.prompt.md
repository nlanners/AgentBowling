# Prompts for 2025-04-14

1. A new day of working on this project. Please create a new .prompts file called `2025-04-14.prompt.md` and begin copying today's prompts into is according to @basic-interaction.mdc

2. Without making any changes to the files, review the@specs files and advise what our next step might be.

3. I believe the Project Setup has already been done, but let's double check. Please ensure that the project is properly set up. Also, during the set up you did previously, you created some @components , @models , and @screens. I don't want these muddying up our implementation. Please remove those as you verify the set up.

4. First, I'd like to set some ground rules for writing the code. To start, please set up ESLint at v9.24.0 and set up some basic eslint rules to govern our code.

5. I will let you know when to start implementing. Before that, we need to continue setting up our rules for creating code. I would like you to create a rule in `.cursor/rules` called `typescript.mdc`. This rule will apply to any file that uses Typescript, ie `.ts, .tsx`. Please fill the rule with the latest (2025) best practices when building code with Typescript. You will follow this rule completely as you write Typescript code.

6. Very good. Now, create a similar rule file for React Native and Expo specific conventions. This will be called `react-native-expo.mdc` and include the latest (2025) Reacti Native and Expo coding conventions and best practices. This rule will apply to all files that use React Native and Expo patterns.

7. One issue: we previously discussed in @persistence.spec.md that React Native no longer uses Async Storage for data persistence. Please update the `react-native-expo` rule to use the persistence model we came up with

8. Something has happened and for some reason, I can't see the changes you made to `react-native-expo.mdc`. Can you check that those changes were made, and if they weren't brainstorm why that may be.

9. Hmmm....Those changes still didn't get applied. I've made some IDE adjustments. Please try it again.

10. Your changes still aren't getting applied to the file. We are going to try something different. Please copy the contents of `react-native-expo.mdc` to a new file called `react-native-expo-2.mdc` and apply your changes. Then remove the original file.

11. Ok, I think we are ready to start coding. First, set up the file structure as outlined in the @specs

12. I have decided I want to make some changes to this structure:

- I want all the components to be in the `components` folder, not split between `components` and `features`
- I want `constants` to be nested under `types`
  Please make these changes to the @specs files and then make the changes to the project structure.

13. We need a way to keep track of our progress in the @technical-plan.spec.md. Please reformate the markdown in this file to include checkboxes for each step. Then look through the project and mark of the steps we have already completed.

14. In a moment. I just noticed the `Estimated Duration` notes in the technical plan. Please remove these as they are unnecessary. This is a largely personal and learning project and the timeframe doesn't matter.

15. Let's to the next unchecked task, "Implement core theme and styling system". What information do you need from me to complete this?

16. Largely, I would like you to make the design choices. I do like more cool colors (blues, greens, purples) as well as grayscale colors. I like rounded corners on elements. Other than that, modern design principles and bowling aesthetics will be fine.
