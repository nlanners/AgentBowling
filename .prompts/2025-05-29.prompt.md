# Prompts for May 29, 2025

- I just checked the MMKV Readme on Github and found this: A mocked MMKV instance is automatically used when testing with Jest or Vitest, so you will be able to use new MMKV() as per normal in your tests. Refer to package/example/test/MMKV.test.ts for an example using Jest. It sounds like we don't need to mock MMKV. Is that true? Give it a try and let me know what you find. You are also permitted to search the web for solutions.
- It appears you got hung up while trying to implement the storage tests. Please review what you've done and continue.
- Please check the @specs folder, specifically the @technical-plan.spec.md and review the project as it currently stands. Confirm the tech plan is up to date. If something is checked off but not finished in the project, let me know what it is.
- Let's discuss the theme and styling system. I know @React Native has a styling system using scoped StyleSheet objects. I've also found a `Nativewind` system which is a version of Tailwind for React Native. Which of these is easier for you to understand, implement, and work with? Is there a different system that you can use consistently?
- I like the system you've outlined. Please update the proper @specs file with this information. We also need to create a Cursor rule to handle this. The last time we worked on styling, you got yourself in a loop overwritting the theming with different methodologies. We want to avoid that. Please clearly and efficientlyl document the process that we want to use before we get started working on it.
- Let's start finishing the styling and theming. Using the @specs and @rules guidance, review our current @ThemeContext.tsx, @theme, and anywhere a `StyleSheet` is used, unify the styling based on what we have documented.
- Check what you've done against the @technical-plan.spec.md and update the plan status as needed.
- It looks like you've checked off some items in Phase 3 and beyond. I want to confirm that Phase 1 and 2 are complete. Earlier you mentioned some Phase 1 and 2 tasks that were only partially complete. Have those been completed? What needs to be done to complete any Phase 1 and 2 tasks?
