- A new day. Let's set up our new prompt file `2025-04-15.prompt.md`.

- I would like to create a github pull request for the work that we have done in the last few sessions. Please create a new file called `pr-description.md`, add it to my .gitignore file, and write an appropriate PR description based on the commits we have made.

- Let's continue development. Please set up the navigation structure

- Please check your work based on the @specs files to ensure you have implemented according to plan. For example, you've put a @types.ts under navigation when it should be under `src/types`. Please correct any errors to match the specs we previously set up.

- I apologize. I was unclear. I want you to look at the work marked out in the @technical-plan.spec.md, specifically the `Set up navigation structure` step, and ensure that you've followed the specifications laid out in the @specs files. Do not do any work for future steps. If any of your current work contradicts the specs or doesn't align correctly, make adjustments.

- Now let's create a Cursor rule to govern this interaction. Please create a `.mdc` file with instructions outlining that during development, once you have completed a prompt from me, to check the @specs files and the @technical-plan.spec.md to ensure alignment with our project goals and make adjustments as necessary. This check should not continue from the current task. It is purely a checking mechanism. Also include a check that there are no errors in the new created code.

- Alright. Let us continue down the @technical-plan.spec.md. First, verify that the navigation structure is set up correclty. If it is, mark that task completed.

- Now start on the data models task.

- I want to take a moment to analyze our rules files. Would it be helpful to you to include file connections to these files? Or is that not necessary to you to follow the rules accurately?

- Thank you. Continue on to the next task of the @technical-plan.spec.md
