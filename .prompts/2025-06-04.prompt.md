- Today is a new day. Please make a new prompt file called `2025-06-04.prompt.md`.
  Then run `npm run typecheck` and fix all the type errors.
- The user asked me to create a new prompt file called `2025-06-04.prompt.md` and then run `npm run typecheck` to fix type errors in their bowling score app. I created the file and ran the typecheck command, which revealed numerous type errors.
- Let's begin on this step. Please complete these pieces, while maintaining type safety (using `npm run typecheck` to verify).
- Excellent. Let's attempt to implement the charts and visual components based on the statistics data. Use React Native Chart Kit to accomplish this.
- When running the app, I am having an error: `Exception thrown when executing UIFramGuarded ViewManagerResolver returned null for either RNSVGRect or RCTRNSVGRect, existing names are:` with an array of names. Please identify, diagnose, and fix this error.
- I have rebuilt and it looks like it is working. Let's continue. Please analyze what we've done and compare to our task list and @technical-plan.spec.md. What is our next step?
- First, let's update the @technical-plan.spec.md with our status. Then, I believe we've added several more @utils functions that need tests written for them. Please review our @specs and our current test files and create unit tests for any function that doesn't currently have one. Make sure to run `npm run test` as you go to verify things are working.
- We need all tests to pass. Please fix the failing tests.
- Alright, let's do one more check before we consider this phase complete. Please review the @technical-plan.spec.md and the other @specs files, and compare to the work done in the project and determine if any more work needs to be done for phase 4 and 5.
- Excellent! Let's create a new PR description in the @pr-description.md file so I can move forward.
