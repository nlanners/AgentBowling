- Another new day. Please make a new prompt file called `2025-06-03.prompt.md`. Then review the project and @specs files to understand where we are in the project.

- A few issues from the end of yesterday:

1. The Reset frame button at the bottom of the game screen is cut off and I can't scroll the page to access it.
2. The auto-scrolling on the ScoreBoard is "kind of" working. But it is inconsistent and often only scrolls by a tiny bit and doesn't keep the active frame on screen.
3. I liked parts of the previous PlayerSetupScreen design more than this. Can you combine them? Especially by adding some padding against the sides of the screen.

Please investigate these issue and make appropriate changes to fix them.

- This all works much better. It looks like we've created a couple type errors though. Please run `npm run typecheck` and fix the errors.

- I got distracted and you timed out. I believe you've fixed the issue but check it again just in case please.

- Excellent. Let's check the @technical-plan.spec.md and decide what to do next.

- Groovy. Let's do one last check that Phase 3 is completed. Do a review of the project, including @technical-plan.spec.md and @specs files to ensure that Phase 3 is completed.

- Alright, I am going to create a Pull Request for this branch. Could you please write an appropriate PR description in the `pr-description.md` file.

- Let us continue to Phase 4. Please outline what needs to happen in Phase 4 along with your plan to accomplish those tasks.

- Begin implementing this plan.

- This is excellent. While we are on these basic end game statistics, can we add a subtitle or question mark icon button that displays and short explanation for what the stat means? For example, I am unclear on what "Open Frames" is tracking.

- Can we make the icon used for this a bit more distinct? Maybe an "i" with a circle around it?

- This is incredibly helpful. Let's continue with the Phase 4 plan. What is the next step?

- It looks like you've implemented a bunch of the storage functionality with AsyncStorage. This tool is no longer a part of React Native. We had decided to use MMKV and you've laid the ground work for that. Please revise your implementations to use MMKV instead of AsyncStorage. Use the @specs files, specifically the @persistence.spec.md spec, to ensure alignment with our original planning.

- When I click on an entry in the Game History page, I get this error. Please diagnose and fix.

- I'm still getting that error when I click a game in the Game History page.

- Good job. That works now. However, it appears there is no button on the Game History page to navigate back to the home screen. Please fix this.

- Excellent. Where are we in our task list? What is the next step?

- Very good. Please implement the Statistics screen.

- When running the app, I get this error. Please identify, diagnose, and fix.

- Now I am getting this error. Please fix.

- Those bugs are fixed. Now, on the Statistics page, each card is too small for the content inside of it. The numbers (the important information) are all cut off my some amount. We need to either make the cards larger or the font sizes, especially of the titles, smaller. Please fix this.

- This looks much better thank you. Where are we in our task list?

- Let's work on the persistence of stats. Implement caching for stats for better performance.

- I think we are ready to take the next step. What is the next step?

- Let's work on the filtering and sorting capabilities first.

- I am getting this error: Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 'RNCDatePicker' could not be found. Verify that a module by this name is registered in the native binary., js engine: hermes
  Please fix.

- It appears there are some special cases around this `react-native-community/datetimepicker` package. Please examine the `npm` page for this package to see if it helps in fixing this error: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/datetimepicker

Also, I do not care about building for ios. Please only build for Android.

- I am still getting the `Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 'RNCDatePicker' could not be found` error. Why am I still getting this error?

- Now I'm getting this error: Unable to resolve "./ConfirmDialog" from "src/components/ui/index.ts". Please fix this.

- When I open the filters of the Game History page, I am unable to scroll the page to see the filters. Please fix this.

- When clicking a game in the Game History page, I get these errors. Please fix them.

- Now I get this error when clicking a game in the Game History page. Please fix.

- Running `npm run typecheck` returns 152 type errors in 29 files. These need to be taken care of. Please fix these type errors.
