- Another new day. Please make a new prompt file called `2025-06-03.prompt.md`. Then review the project and @specs files to understand where we are in the project.

- A few issues from the end of yesterday:

1. The Reset frame button at the bottom of the game screen is cut off and I can't scroll the page to access it.
2. The auto-scrolling on the ScoreBoard is "kind of" working. But it is inconsistent and often only scrolls by a tiny bit and doesn't keep the active frame on screen.
3. I liked parts of the previous PlayerSetupScreen design more than this. Can you combine them? Especially by adding some padding against the sides of the screen.

Please investigate these issue and make appropriate changes to fix them.

- This all works much better. It looks like we've created a couple type errors though. Please run `npm run typecheck` and fix the errors.

- I got distracted and you timed out. I believe you've fixed the issue but check it again just in case please.

- Excellent. Let's check the @technical-plan.spec.md and decide what to do next.

- Groovy. Let's do one last check that Phase 3 is completed. Do a review of the project, including @technical-plan.spec.md and @specs files to ensure that Phase 3 is completed.

- Alright, I am going to create a Pull Request for this branch. Could you please write an appropriate PR description in the `pr-description.md` file.
