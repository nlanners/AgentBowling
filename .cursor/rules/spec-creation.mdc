# Specification Creation Rule

## Description

This rule governs the process of creating specification files (`.spec.md`) for the bowling score app project. During this phase, no code should be written until explicitly directed by the user.

## Scope

- Applies to any prompts concerning writing `.spec.md` files
- Applies to all specification development phases

## Instructions

1. Specification files must be written in Markdown format.
2. NO code or code snippets should be written while working on specification files.
3. Focus on documenting requirements, features, user stories, and technical design.
4. Wait for explicit instructions from the user before implementing any code from the specifications.
5. Specification files should be clear, detailed, and organized to serve as proper documentation.

## Priority

High - these instructions take precedence during the specification phase and should be followed strictly until explicitly directed otherwise by the user.
