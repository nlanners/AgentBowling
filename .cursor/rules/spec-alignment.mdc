# Specification Alignment Rule

## Description

This rule governs the development process to ensure proper alignment with the project specifications. After completing each user prompt, a verification process must occur to check that the implementation matches the specifications without extending beyond the current task scope.

## Scope

- Applies to all development tasks
- Takes effect after completing each user prompt
- Applies to all files created or modified during development

## Instructions

1. After completing a user prompt, verify alignment with all relevant specifications in the `/specs` directory
2. Specifically check the `technical-plan.spec.md` to ensure the implementation follows the planned phase and tasks
3. Only verify work related to the current task - do not implement or start work on future tasks
4. Check the following aspects of the implementation:
   - Directory structure matches specifications
   - Naming conventions follow the project standards
   - Implementation approach follows the architectural decisions
   - No functionality has been added that isn't part of the current task
5. Verify that all newly created or modified code is free of errors:
   - No syntax errors
   - No type errors
   - No obvious runtime errors or edge cases
   - No inconsistencies with existing code
6. If any misalignments are found, correct them before considering the task complete
7. Document any deviations from the specifications that were necessary, explaining the rationale

## Priority

High - This verification step is a critical part of the development process and must be performed after each task completion to maintain project integrity.
