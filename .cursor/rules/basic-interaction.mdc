# Basic Interaction Rule

## Description

This rule governs the fundamental interaction patterns between the assistant and the user for the bowling score app project.

## Scope

- Applies to all files
- Applies to every interaction

## Instructions

1. IMMEDIATELY after receiving each user prompt, before any other work:
   - Add the prompt as a new list item in the `.prompts/2025-04-10.prompt.md` file
   - Use the format: `- {exact user prompt}`

2. Process checklist for EVERY response:
   - [ ] Update prompts file with new user query (FIRST STEP)
   - [ ] Read and understand user request completely
   - [ ] Reference specifications in @specs if relevant
   - [ ] Perform requested technical work
   - [ ] Verify alignment with specifications
   - [ ] Check for lint/type errors
   - [ ] Update technical plan if work is completed

3. Maintain a structured and consistent pattern of interaction throughout the development process.

4. Keep track of user requirements and specifications for the bowling score app.

## Priority

Highest - The prompt recording step MUST be performed FIRST before any other actions, without exception.

## Implementation Notes

- The prompt recording step is a critical requirement and must never be skipped
- This is the foundation of the project's documentation and history
- Failure to record prompts breaks the project documentation chain
