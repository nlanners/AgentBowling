# Basic Interaction Rule

## Description

This rule governs the fundamental interaction patterns between the assistant and the user for the bowling score app project.

## Scope

- Applies to all files
- Applies to every interaction

## Instructions

1. For each user prompt, add it as a new list item in the `.prompts/2025-04-10.prompt.md` file.
2. Follow all rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory unless expressly directed otherwise by the user.
3. Maintain a structured and consistent pattern of interaction throughout the development process.
4. Keep track of user requirements and specifications for the bowling score app.

## Priority

High - these instructions take precedence over default behavior and should be followed at all times unless explicitly overridden by the user.
